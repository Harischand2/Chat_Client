# Chat_Client
The goal of this project is to create a chat client that is able to communicate
with a server. The client will send messages to the server, which is then able to
broadcast the message to all the other clients on the system. Similarly, the
client will be able to receive messages directly from the server, thus enabling
the user to read messages sent by all other clients on the system.
